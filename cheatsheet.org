** Registers
*** Scratch
  - rax - accumulator
  - rcx - cycles (loops)
  - rdx - store data during i/o ops
  - rsi - source index in string manip cmds
  - rdi - destination index in str manip cmds
  - r8, r9, r10, r11 

*** Reserved
  - rsp - addr of topmost el in hw stack
  - rbp - stack frame's base
  - rbx - base register; used for addresssing in early cpus
  - r12, r13, r14, r15

** Functions
  - functions need to preserve the following registers: ~rbx~, ~rbp~, ~rsp~, ~r12-15~
  - return value goes into ~rax~
